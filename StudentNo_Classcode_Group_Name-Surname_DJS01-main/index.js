// Given Parameters
const velocity = 10000; // velocity (km/h)
const acceleration = 3; // acceleration (m/s^2)
const time = 3600; // seconds (1 hour)
const distance = 0; // distance (km)
const fuel = 5000; // remaining fuel (kg)
const fbr = 0.5; // fuel burn rate (kg/s)


// Conversion factor for acceleration
const conversionFactor = { m_s2_to_kmh: 3.6 }; // 1 m/s^2 â‰ˆ 3.6 km/h

const distance2 = distance + (velocity * time) //calcultes new distance


const rf = fbr * time //calculates remaining fuel
const vel2 = calcNewVel(velocity, acceleration, time) //calculates new velocity based on acceleration

// Pick up an error with how the function below is called and make it robust to such errors
calcNewVel = (velocity, acceleration, time) => {
  return velocity + (acceleration * time)
}

console.log(`Corrected New Velocity: ${vel2} km/h`);
console.log(`Corrected New Distance: ${d2} km`);
console.log(`Corrected Remaining Fuel: ${rf} kg`);
