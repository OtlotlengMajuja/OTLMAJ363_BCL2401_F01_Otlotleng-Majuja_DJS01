// Given Parameters
const velocity = 10000; // velocity (km/h)
const acceleration = 3; // acceleration (m/s^2)
const time = 3600; // seconds (1 hour)
const distance = 0; // distance (km)
const fuel = 5000; // remaining fuel (kg)
const fbr = 0.5; // fuel burn rate (kg/s)
// Conversion factor for acceleration
const conversionFactor = { m_s2_to_kmh: 3.6 }; // 1 m/s^2 â‰ˆ 3.6 km/h

// Convert the time to hours for consistent unit
const distance2 = distance + (velocity * (time / 3600)); //Calculates new distance

// Calulate the remaining fuel
const rf = fuel - (fbr * time); //calculates remaining fuel

// Pick up an error with how the function below is called and make it robust to such errors
calcNewVel = (velocity, acceleration, time) => {
  const acc2 = acceleration * conversionFactor.m_s2_to_kmh; // Access the conversion factor property
  return velocity + (acc2 * time)
}

const vel2 = calcNewVel(velocity, acceleration, time);  //calculates new velocity based on acceleration

console.log(`Corrected New Velocity: ${vel2} km/h`);
console.log(`Corrected New Distance: ${distance2} km`);
console.log(`Corrected Remaining Fuel: ${rf} kg`);
